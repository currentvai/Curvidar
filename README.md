**Curvidar** is a one-command script to set up your Termux for downloading YouTube videos and audio with an interactive menu, just by sharing a link.

This script installs all necessary tools like `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and `aria2c`, and then configures the `termux-url-opener` for a seamless experience.

## Features

-   üé¨ **Interactive Menu**: Choose video quality (1080p, 720p, 480p) or audio format (m4a, mp3).
-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast Downloads**: Uses `aria2c` for accelerated, multi-connection downloads.
-   üéµ **Audio & Video**: Download both video and audio-only files.
-   üñºÔ∏è **Metadata & Thumbnails**: Automatically embeds metadata and thumbnails.
-   üìÅ **Organized**: All downloads are saved to the `storage/shared/YouTube` folder.
